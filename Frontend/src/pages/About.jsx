            <p>
              Founded in 2024 by a team of passionate travelers and technology enthusiasts, WanderWise was born 
              from the frustration of spending countless hours planning trips only to miss out on the best experiences. 
              We realized that travel planning should be as exciting as the journey itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, WanderWise serves thousands of travelers worldwide, helping them discover amazing destinations, 
              connect with like-minded adventurers, and create memories that last a lifetime. From solo backpackers 
              to family vacations, from weekend getaways to month-long expeditions â€“ we're here to make every trip 
              extraordinary.
